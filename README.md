# Sketchr2
Draw something, again!

This is an attempt to recreate a project I worked on while attending The Iron Yard.
The project was a collaboration between Dina O'Connor - https://github.com/DinaOC,
Patrick Coleman - https://github.com/colemanrpatrick, and myself.

I am rewriting all code from the ground up, while trying to use best coding practices.
The original code can be found at https://github.com/TheSKETCHr/SKETCHr
